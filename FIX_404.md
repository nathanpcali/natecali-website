# Fix 404 Error on GitHub Pages

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. Files Not Committed/Pushed to GitHub

**Check in GitHub Desktop:**
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Look at the bottom left - do you see any uncommitted changes?
3. If yes:
   - Type a commit message: "Initial website files"
   - Click **"Commit to main"**
   - Click **"Push origin"** (top right)

**Check on GitHub.com:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nathanpcali/natecali-website
2. Click on the repository
3. Do you see `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files?
4. If NO - the files weren't pushed. Go back to GitHub Desktop and push them.

### 2. Files in Wrong Location

**Verify file structure on GitHub:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nathanpcali/natecali-website
2. You should see these files in the ROOT (not in a subfolder):
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`

If files are in a subfolder, they need to be in the root.

### 3. GitHub Pages Still Building

**Wait and check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nathanpcali/natecali-website/actions
2. Look for a "pages build and deployment" workflow
3. If it's running, wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Then refresh your site

### 4. Force a Rebuild

**Trigger a new build:**
1. In GitHub Desktop, make a small change to any file (add a space)
2. Commit: "Trigger Pages rebuild"
3. Push to GitHub
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Refresh your site

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **Check for uncommitted changes** (bottom left)
3. **If there are changes:**
   - Commit them
   - Push to GitHub
4. **Verify on GitHub.com:**
   - Go to your repository
   - Confirm `index.html` is visible in the root
5. **Check Pages settings:**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** and refresh your site

---

## Still Not Working?

**Manual verification:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/nathanpcali/natecali-website/blob/main/index.html
2. If this page loads, the file is there
3. If you get 404, the file isn't in the repository

**If file is missing:**
- Go back to GitHub Desktop
- Make sure all files are committed and pushed
- Check the repository on GitHub.com to confirm files are there
